SFAudioShield
=============

Arduino library to control the SparkFun audio player. Plays Ogg, MP3, and AAC (iTunes m4a) files.

Requires #define SD_FAT_VERSION 20111205 of the Arduino SdFat library. The Arduino's builtin
SdFat library will likely not work. :-(

Also requires the digitalWriteFast library.

The good news is that these things are easily findable on the web.

The bad news is that this library comes with NO SUPPORT. I am the author of a few Arduino libraries,
such as the PinChangeInt library. For those, I am commited to making them work for people- even
though it takes time away from my other projects.

For this one, I am committed to nothing. No bug fixes, no updates, no nothin'. What I do here is
at my own leisure and for my own project (and pleasure). I don't have time to support this thing
and help you make it work. 

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT'S FILLED WITH CRAZY PRINT STATEMENTS, CRUFT, STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS
CODE CRAP AND GARBAGE. DON'T DIVE INTO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO MAKE IT WORK ON YOUR OWN.

But it may be interesting to you, and it may work for you, or it may help you move along in
your own project. That would be great; that's why I put it up on github. But it's not here to
be a nice giftwrapped library.

I need help with this thing, if anything. So if you're willing to contribute updates, fixes,
or any other help at all, that would be great. Let me know with an email.
